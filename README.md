# PhD - Plant Breeding, Genetics, And Biotechnology

Michigan State University
Area of Expertise: Quantitative trait loci analysis, genome-wide association and genomic prediction in dry bean.
I earned my bachelor's degree in biology from Universidad del Tolima in Colombia. Following my graduation, I became a part of the International Center of Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), where my research centered on dry beans. Later, I contributed to various projects at the Colombian Sugarcane Research Center (CENICAÃ‘A). Throughout my career, I've delved into the relationship between genotype and phenotype in plant breeding.

I pursued my Ph.D. in Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Biotechnology at Michigan State University. My doctoral work focused on the application of genomic prediction in dry beans, with the goal of expediting genetic progress in essential traits such as yield, mineral concentration, and end-use quality. Currently, I am a research associate at the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center. My research encompasses computational sciences and genomic prediction across different crops.
