ABOUT ME
PhDc - Plant Breeding, Genetics, And Biotechnology
Michigan State University

Area of Expertise: Quantitative trait loci analysis, genome-wide association and genomic prediction in dry bean.

I completed my bachelor’s degree in biology at the University of Tolima in Colombia. After getting the bachelor’s degree, I worked in the International Center of Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in dry beans and then in the Colombian Sugarcane Research Center (CENICAÑA). I have worked in the association genotype-phenotype in several traits of agronomic importance. Currently, my PhD focuses in the implementation of genomic prediction in dry beans to increase the genetic gain per unit of time in traits as yield, mineral concentration, and end-use quality traits. In my free time I love to travel, exercise and gardening.
