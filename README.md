## 👨‍🔬 About Me

### Paulo Izquierdo, Ph.D.  
**Research Associate – Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center**  
**Ph.D. – Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Biotechnology, Michigan State University**

I am a plant geneticist and computational biologist with a strong focus on the integration of genomics and quantitative genetics to accelerate genetic gain in crops. My research expertise includes **quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis**, **genome-wide association studies (GWAS)**, and **genomic prediction**, primarily in dry beans and bioenergy crops.

## 🎓 Education & Background

I earned my **bachelor’s degree in Biology** from **Universidad del Tolima** in Colombia. After graduation, I joined the **International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)**, where I worked on dry bean improvement. Later, I collaborated on breeding and genomics projects at the **Colombian Sugarcane Research Center (CENICAÑA)**.

I completed my **Ph.D. in Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Biotechnology** at **Michigan State University**, where my research focused on applying genomic prediction in dry bean breeding. My doctoral work aimed to accelerate genetic improvement for key traits including **yield**, **mineral concentration**, and **canning quality**.
